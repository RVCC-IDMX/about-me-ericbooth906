With a goal of creating a "professional" looking site, I selected muted colors.
There are a few complementary colors such as Dim Grey (#696969), Light Steel Blue (#B0C4DE), and White (#FFFFF) added in as well.

# A Note About Hobbies
Maybe something here
# If You're looking at This........

Congratulations! You've found a README.md article, something that I did not know existed prior to this course. Now, look at me, adding fonts and color and graphics and trying to explain why this site is interesting.

Actually, I think the Variable Fonts information ***is*** pretty interesting and a testament to the value of developers and creators moving out of their silos to improve the overall functioning of web design.
