                <section>
                    Welcome to my website created for my web development course which I've created to display the skills addressed in the class.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The focus of the "About Me" project is to create a basic HTML page in VS Code, including cascading style sheets (CSS Code).
                    File system basics, naming rules, color selection, embedded media (photo and video) and navigation structures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Also stressed was the importance of using responsive design to ensure that site format works for a variety of screen sizes.
                    In addition,the importance of addressing access issues was also included.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This site includes a number of required sections, listed below:

            <div class="hide">Fishing is a way to relax and appreciate nature. Far from a mindless task, successful fishing requires planning and 
                preparation that includes awareness of environmental and weather conditions, appropriate clothing and equipment, and awareness of local environmental regulations and licensing.
                I often research the lake/ocean territory ahead of time to ensure that I have the correct bait. I also prepare for potential emergencies and bring necessary items (including food and water) that I need for the day.
                <br>
                I generally "catch and release" but many fish for sustenance.

            <div class="hide">I have been lucky to travel extensively - my parents instilled a love for exploration in me that I will hold throughout my life.
                By the time I graduated from high school, I had visited all 48 continental states (missing Alaska and Hawaii) and numerous countries. Before college
                began, we visited Iceland and went whale-wwatching near the Arctic Circle.
            <br>
                We have visited many National Parks and I WILL climb Half-Dome in Yosemite at some point.
            <br>
                Travel opens up your mind to new cultures and beliefs. It raises awareness of the importance of understanding history and respecting the environment.

            <div class="myDIV">Video Games</div>
            <div class="hide">For me. gaming is a way to unwind. As a working college student, this is a way to take a short escape from the assignments and stresses of the day. During COVID lockdowns, it was a way to stay in touch when in-person contact was limited.
                For some, gaming holds a bad reputation as an escape from reality that limits physical activity, inhibits relationships, and mind numbing. For me, certain games have allowed me to 
                indulge in my love of history and learn details that might seem mundane when presented in a book or lecture. Other games require strategy and teamwork. 
                Take a look at this scholarly article which discusses some positive results from gaming <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/126/1/180/6244057">Deep Play? Video Games and the Historical Imaginary</a>.

                    <h1>An Introduction to Variable Fonts</h1>
                    <div>
                    <p>New font technology - <strong>Open Font Variations</strong> informally referred to as “variable
                        fonts” was released in 2016 as a joint initiative of Adobe, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and has
                        had a huge impact on web development and presentation. There is a difference between font and
                        typeface: a typeface is the underlying visual design that can exist in many different
                        typesetting technologies; a font is one of these implementations, in a digital file format.
                        In other words, a typeface is what you see, and the font is what you use.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        OpenType specifications allow developers to access all the styles contained in a single font
                        file without worrying about browser distortions like fake bolds or italics, making styling
                        easier and offering benefits such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smaller file size</li>
                        <li>Only one file</li>
                        <li>Flexible design range</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>
                        This change is a boon to creators who previously were forced to balance design expressiveness
                        (the number of fonts used) with website performance (the amount of data to download).
                        Downloading a single file instead of multiple individual fonts can yield a significant
                        performance gain in reduced file size and fewer file requests.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The variation axis expresses a single aspect of typeface design. There are two types of axes -
                        registered and custom - and five registered axes, which control known, predictable features of
                        the font:
                    </p>

                    <p3>Italic (ital)
                    <br>
                    ( CSS attribute: font-style)</p3>
                    <br>
                    The italic axis usually means slanted strokes. Having italics available alongside the upright forms
                    is useful when combined with weight to handle everyday needs for body copy, requiring only 1 or 2
                    files instead of at least 4.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp <fit>This is Dosis Italic</fit>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p4>Weight (wght)
                    <br>( CSS attribute: font-weight)</p4>
                    <br>
                    The weight axis defines how light or bold a font looks and can range from lighter/thinner weight to
                    super heavy extremes. Variable fonts allow designers to choose values (expressed as minimum and
                    maximum numeric values) in order to highlight various elements.
                    <br>
                    <f1>Font weight 100</f1>
                    <br>
                    <f5>Font weight 500</f5>
                    <br>
                    <f9>Font weight 900</f9>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                                       
                    <p6>Slant (slnt)
                    <br>( CSS attribute: font-style) </p6>
                    <br>
                    Slant is similar but slightly different than italic. Slant is expressed as a degree continuum such
                    as “greater than -90 and less than +90” and, also does not contain the glyph substitution that is
                    present inn italic.
                    &nbsp &nbsp <slant>This text has a slant</slant>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    
                    <p7>Optical size (opsz)

                    <br>
                    A good optical-size axis makes type more legible at smaller sizes, a process that dates back to
                    printing in the early 16th century, when punch cutters hand-carved type out of metal and would cut
                    smaller type with slightly thicker strokes so that it would print well and be legible at smaller
                    sizes

                    <p8>Width (wdth)
                    <br>( CSS attribute: font-stretch)</p8>
                    <br>
                    In typeface design, width design is expressed using terms such as condensed, compressed, or extended
                    to identify narrow or wide a font is relative to the “normal” design.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp <str>This is stretched text</str>  &nbsp &nbsp <str1>This is ultra-expanded text</str1>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        In addition, to the above type designers can create infinite variations by customizing the axes
                        for grade, expressiveness, the ascender and descender height of lowercase letters, and other
                        innovative modifications.

                        Modern web development has benefitted from the wisdom of the ages, especially the concept of
                        optical sizing, which fell out of practice in the age of digital type and photo typesetting yet
                        has come back in full force as visual presentation must be responsive to screen sizes that range
                        from phone to desktop. OpenType Font Variations showcase the benefits that can occur when
                        content creators and designers work effectively with the tech side of the house to address
                        issues on both sides of the web development.
